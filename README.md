# Diversion 

Diversion lets you divert raw input events like keypresses and mousemovements from the [Linux Input Subsystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.18/input/input_uapi.html) into a Lua script.
This Lua script can then send custom events to a [virtual input device (uinput)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.18/input/uinput.html).

You have to manually forward an event to the virtual input device if you want the rest of your system to receive it.
That's because Diversion asked the kernel for exclusive access to the input devices so no other process on your machine will receive the events, not even X or Wayland.

## Installing
```bash
cargo build --release
cp ./target/release/diversion ~/.local/bin/
```
## Running
```bash
diversion --name <virual-input-device-name> <lua-script> [devices]...
```
Example:
```bash
diversion -- --name "diversion" ./main.lua /dev/input/by-id/usb-NOVATEK_USB_Keyboard-event-kbd /dev/input/by-id/usb-ASUS_ROG_PUGIO-event-mouse
```
Input devices in linux are represented as files in the **/dev/input/** directory.

To let Diversion use a device you need to find the path to this file and pass it to diversion.

In the **/dev/input/by-id/** directory are symlinks to these files with helpful device names.

To test whether you found the correct device you can simply cat the file and press some buttons, if you see a bunch of binary garbage whenever you press something then you got the the right file.

## Lua Interface
The Lua interface is provided by the [**diversion.lua**](https://github.com/Blugatroff/diversion/diversion.lua) module.

- **listen**(listener: (**device_id**: number, **type**: number, **code**: number, **value**: number) -> void)<br>
    Attach a listener function to receive events from diversion.<br>

    **device_id** is the index to the path of the device in the arguments passed to Diversion, e.g. <em>usb-ASUS_ROG_PUGIO-event-mouse</em> from the example would have id 1.

    **type** is the event type see: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.18/input/event-codes.html#event-types

    **code:** for keyboards this is the scancode, for mouse movements this is the axis, etc.

    **value:** for mouse movements this is the distance traveled, for keyboards this is either 1 for down 0 for up or 2 for repeated.
    
    There can only be one listener, calling this function twice will remove the first listener.
- **send_event**(type: number, code: number, value: number)<br>
    Send an input event to the virtual input device.
- **reload**()<br>
    Reload the script, this is useful for editing the script without having to restart Diversion.
- **execute**(cmd: string, args: string[]) -> Promise<br>
    Execute a command asynchronously.<br>

    Your should always use this instead of **os.execute** from the standard library of Lua.<br>
    The native **[os.execute()](https://www.lua.org/pil/22.2.html)** from the standard library of Lua is blocking, which means that the script will block the entire main thread of Diversion and no events will be received. So if you wanted to create a shortcut to run some command then every device you passed to Diversion will be frozen whenever that command is running.

    This function returns a **Promise** which will, as soon as the command exits, resolve to a table with the fields **stdout**, **stderr** and **code**.

## Examples
The [**examples**](https://github.com/Blugatroff/diversion/tree/main/examples/) directory contains the following examples.<br>
You can run them like this:
```bash
diversion --name "diversion" ./example/hello.lua [devices]...
```
- **hello.lua** <br>
    This is the simplest script, all it does is flip flip **A** and **B** on every keyboard.
- **mouse.lua** <br>
    Reverse the direction of all mouse movement while **L_CTRL** is pressed.
- **reload.lua** <br>
    Reload the currently running scripts when **F2** was pressed.
- **print_events.lua** <br>
    Print every received event while **F2** is pressed.

You can also have a look at the shortcuts i am currenty using myself [here](https://github.com/Blugatroff/diversions) although that might not be very helpful since i didn't write any comments there.

## How it works
Diversion grabs exclusive access of every input device using the [EVIOCGRAB ioctl syscall](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/aa051d36ce4ae23b488489f6b15abad68b59ca23/include/uapi/linux/input.h#L183).

Diversion creates a virtual input device using the [uinput kernel module](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.18/input/uinput.html) like this:
1. /dev/uinput is opened.
2. The event types EV_SYN, EV_KEY, EV_REL and EV_MSC are enabled with the [UI_SET_EVBIT](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/include/uapi/linux/uinput.h#L137) ioctl.
3. Events for every keycode are enabled with the [UI_SET_KEYBIT](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/include/uapi/linux/uinput.h#L138) ioctl.
4. Events for every relative movement are enabled with the [UI_SET_RELBIT](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/include/uapi/linux/uinput.h#L139) ioctl.
5. The [UI_DEV_SETUP](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/include/uapi/linux/uinput.h#L74) ioctl is called which passes the custom device name.
6. The [UI_DEV_CREATE](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/include/uapi/linux/uinput.h#L64) ioctl is called.
7. Wait for input events on any device using [libc::select](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html).
8. Pass the received event to Lua using [mlua](https://lib.rs/crates/mlua).
9. Go to step 7.

## Doesn't all this add latency to every keypress?
**Yes.**

However, as long as you don't compute the first 500 digits of PI on every keypress **you won't be able to notice.**<br>
At least i certainly couldn't.
